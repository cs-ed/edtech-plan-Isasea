# Ms. Barboza's Educational Technology Plan


## Context

### Course

Introduction Computer Science course for Middle Schoolers

### Situation

The middle school I will be working at is part of Paramount Unified School District, a district located in Southern California. An asset at my school that will help are the large computer classrooms that are available on campus. Having these roomier classrooms can help students have enough space to work in groups and experience an environment where growth in class can happen in groups. Students will have no problem accessing the web on campus because there is a huge department in the district that takes care of any outages and provides rapid solutions. Each student has a laptop assigned to them to take home and will have full size computers in the computer classrooms that they will use. Each student will have two working devices for this course in order to support students with their work. The middle school is a Title I school that has about 900 students from grades 6th to 8th. With various electives this introductory course has limitations with the number of students who will sign up for the class. Advertisement for this course are done during 3rd period announcements and this course usually has more males signed up for it than females.
A constraint that we have at our campus is that students are taking a computer class for the very first time and there is no resources for teachers like textbooks for this course. Lack of resources can create an impediment for learning all the fundamental introductory Computer Course topics. Since the computer lab is big the computer class will be about 36 students which is a larger class where students might not have that 1:1 attention. Not all students have internet access at home to complete their homework and this can cause problems in the long run. Class is an elective and when students are not able to get their first choice of elective, they will be put in this class even though they do not have any interest in this class. This school is a Title 1 school. Math coach oversees this course and there is not a Computer Science coach at the district level.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

Online software used in the classroom will be Scratch as well as Hour of Code. Scratch will be used in order to help students use different sprites and have an opportunity to experience block code before there is any exposure of any type of code. Students can use any computer and still have access to their work without needing a special software installed on their computers. These two websites are easy to access and are free to use. 

### Hardware Specifications


Students have:
HP Chromebook 
Chrome OS 64
Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 600
4 GB memory; 32 GB eMMC 
4 GB LPDDr4-3733 MHz RAM


Teachers have:
Lenovo Thinkpad 
Windows 10
Intel Core i7 6600U (4MB Cache, Up to 3.4 GHz)
12 GB Memory; SSD	256GB



### Application
Scratch will help students go through challenges through out the classroom. 
Students will always get the answers in class by giving them small "hacks" that will guide them to start on their Scratch code. First students will come to class and
get a paper that has some short cuts to create the program we need. Students will start with Scratch starter projects to help them learn new concepts in coding.
Outside of my classroom students will be given starter codes and reflection pieces. Homework will be given in class and worked on in class during the week to help students have a guide as they are doing their work. Assessments will be on basic coding language of Scratch. Students will be asked to complete basic codes in Scratch as part of quiz grades and more complicated codes will be required for tests.Homework has to be done in class in order to provide all students with a computer that can support the software and has fast internet. Addiitonally students need to demonstrate their knowledge of basic commands on scratch and should be given an opportunity to show their knowledge. 

Day to Day:


### Impacts


This impact section will address topics in Computer Science Education that are currently affecting students of different backgrounds and have contributed to the lack of representation in the field of their Computer Science. The first group of students who have been misrepresented in the STEM fields which are students who do not have internet access at home or even access to basic internet. The second group of students who have been affected are women. Lastly students of color have also been almost nonexistent in this field.

It is crucial to address the focus of this course to understand how it will help minority, students of lower communities, and women join the field. This course is designed to expose all students to the world of coding and its possibility of creating their creative solutions to the problems of today and even the future. Although students will not be creating code in  C++, C, Python, or Java they will have an introduction to a course before they have decided that they enjoy coding. It is an important course that will either make students love coding or just decide it is not for them. Students of this district who are majority minorities will be exposed to basic coding software that is available online with block coding where commands are easier to understand for those who are just becoming familiar with coding.  With this exposure I hope that students will pursue to learn more about non-block coding programs and one day help others who might not know of the existence of coding. This class will help my students understand about some of the history of Computer Science and how representation in STEM fields lack people like them and this could be a reason why there are some solutions unsolved we need them in the field. 

Representation in Computer Science matters. In Computer Science it is important to understand that historically those who had money would be able to access computers and the internet while those who did not were left behind. Early marketing aimed to sell computers to affluent, white boys. This leaves students of colors and women out of the fields of computer science for many years. Because of this it is important that our students are able access computer science classes make up for all the years they were left out of the narrative. According to an article on PBS, African American and Hispanics made less than 10% of the Computer Science workforce. My district has predominately students of color who can no longer be ignored or set aside from these fields because we need their own creativity to solve the next set of problems of the 21st century. In my school district my students deserve the right to be able to choose to go into this field regardless of their gender and their skin color or gender. Coding no longer is a manâ€™s world as you can see sites like SheCodes aim to promote more women to become Computer Scientists. According to SheCodes 25% of women are in the field of Computer Science and make 30%. Thankfully this course will allow students to be exposed to creatively making their assignments and hopefully my students will grow to enjoy coding.

The digital divide that exists during this time is an important reason why this course should be taught in any school district. Every child should have the opportunity to know the basics of computers but also learn that computers are not just for browsing the web but can help resolve problems or can be used to showcase their creativity. Since not everyone has access to a computer it is important that by allowing students to join this course they are able to close the gap between those who have grown with computers at home and feel very comfortable with their usage and have an advantage between those who have not. Sparking interest in students of all economic status is important. 

Approaches for this class based on my situation and the history of Computer Science include having assignments be completed in class to avoid anyone not doing their work at home due to internet connection but most importantly to allow students to ask for guidance. The last thing that I want from my students is for them to be discouraged because the course has a lot of gaps for them, or they are not getting help at home. Finding someone who can work with block coding or even coding is hard enough so this is the support that will be in place in the classroom. The Problets are a way to engage the class as a whole and create good conversations within class time. Again all of this will be done to create an environment where students can ask questions and they can be included in the learning. Using this, I hope will get all students to feel like they are  future Computer Scientists.
