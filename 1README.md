# Ms. Barboza's Educational Technology Plan


## Context

### Course

>Introduction Computer Science course for Middle Schoolers

### Situation
>Assets at my school that will help are the large computer classrooms that are available on campus. Having these roomier classrooms can help students have enough space to work in groups and experience an environment where growth in class can happen in groups.  Students will have no problem accesing the web because they have a laptop assigned to them to take home and will have full size computers in the computer classrooms that they will use. Each student will have two working devices for this course. 

>A constraint that we have at our campus is that students are taking a computer class for the very first time and there is no resources for teachers like textbooks for this course. Lack of resources can created an impediment for learning all the fundamental introductory  Computer Course topics. Since the computer lab is big the computer class will be about 36 students which is a larger class where students might not have that 1:1 attention.  Not all students have internet access at home to complete their homework and this can cause problems in the long run.
>>>Class is an elective and when students are not able to get their first choice of elective they will be put in this class even thought they do not have any interest in this class.
>>>This school is a Title 1 school.
>>>Math coach oversees this course and there is not a Computer Science coach at the district level.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

>Online software used in the classroom will be Scratch as well as Hour of Code. Scratch will be used in order to help students use different sprites and have an opportunity to experience block code before there is any exposure of any type of code. Students can use any computer and still have access to their work without needing a special software installed on their computers. These two websites are easy to access and are free to use. 

### Hardware Specifications


Students have:
HP Chromebook 
Chrome OS 64
Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 600
4 GB memory; 32 GB eMMC 
4 GB LPDDr4-3733 MHz RAM


Teachers have:
Lenovo Thinkpad 
Windows 10
Intel Core i7 6600U (4MB Cache, Up to 3.4 GHz)
12 GB Memory; SSD	256GB



### Application
Scratch will help students go through challenges through out the classroom. 
Students will always get the answers in class by giving them small "hacks" that will guide them to start on their Scratch code. First students will come to class and
get a paper that has some short cuts to create the program we need. Students will start with Scratch starter projects to help them learn new concepts in coding.
Outside of my classroom students will be given starter codes and reflection pieces. Homework will be given in class and worked on in class during the week to help students have a guide as they are doing their work. Assessments will be on basic coding language of Scratch. Students will be asked to complete basic codes in Scratch as part of quiz grades and more complicated codes will be required for tests.Homework has to be done in class in order to provide all students with a computer that can support the software and has fast internet. Addiitonally students need to demonstrate their knowledge of basic commands on scratch and should be given an opportunity to show their knowledge. 

### Impacts


This course is designed to expose students to the world of coding and it's possibility not only in a career choice but as a way to use creativity to solve any problem/task. Although students will not be creating codes on C++, C, Python, or Java they will be introduced to a course before they are able to be exposed to the coding languages in order to help students feel they have the basics before they start coding. Students of this district will be able to be exposed to basic coding softwares that are online and easy to play with the comamnds. With this exposure I hope that students will pursue to learn more about non block coding programs and one day help others who might not know of the existence of coding. This class will help students create opportunities for others who are underpresented in STEM fields like themselves.




Representation matters
It is important that there is an acknowledgment of who historically had access to computers and who marketing aimed to sell computers to. Computers have been marketed to affluent ,white boys. This leaves students of colors and women out of the fields of computer science for many years. Because of this it is important that our students are able access computer science classes  make up for all the years they were left out. According to PBS in 2010 there was 18.7 percent of women in Computer Science. Additionally African American and Hispanics made less than 10% of the Comptuer science
