# Ms. Barboza's Educational Technology Plan


## Context

### Course

Introduction Computer Science course for Middle Schoolers for Paramount Unified School Districts.

### Situation

The middle school I will be working at is part of Paramount Unified School District, a district located in Southern California. An asset at my school that will help are the large computer classrooms that are available on campus. Having these roomier classrooms can help students have enough space to work in groups and experience an environment where growth in class can happen in groups. Students will have no problem accessing the web on campus because there is a huge department in the district that takes care of any outages and provides rapid solutions. Each student has a laptop assigned to them to take home and will have full size computers in the computer classrooms that they will use. Each student will have two working devices for this course in order to support students with their work. The middle school is a Title I school that has about 900 students from grades 6th to 8th. 

A constraint that we have at our campus is that students are taking a computer class for the very first time and there is no resources for teachers like textbooks. Lack of resources can create an impediment for learning all the fundamental introductory computer science course topics. Since the computer lab is large the computer class will be about 36 students, and some students are there because they chose the course  but as time passes the numbers will increase with students who did not want to take the course which can create behavior problems. This larger classroom may have students who might not have that 1:1 attention. Not all students have internet access at home to complete their homework and this can cause problems in the long run. Class is an elective and when students are not able to get their first choice of elective, they will be put in this class even though they do not have any interest in this class throughout the entire school year not just during a certain period which might disrupt some time dedicated to work. In the middle school the math coach oversees this course and there is not a Computer Science coach at the district level so there is no one who can provide support of the content. Additionally, with various electives students can choose from this introductory course has proven not too popular with the number of students who will sign up for the class and thus there is no book assigned or resources allotted for this course everything needs to be done from online free resources already available. This class can end up being smaller and benefits less students who truly like Computer Science.  Advertisement for this course is done during 3rd period announcements and this course usually has more males signed up for it than females In this district.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Online software used in the classroom will be Scratch as well as Hour of Code. Scratch will be used as part of problets in the course. Aside from daily problets Scratch has youtube tutorials available to students free of charge and will be used to guide students throughout the course.  Since the school has limited funding for this course Scratch is perfect because it is free of charge and there is enough information on how to use Scratch in the world wide web. 
 The second software that will be used is Hour of Code because it is available online free of use for anyone around the world. This site is easy to navigate to both the teacher and the student that it makes sense to expose students to coding. Hour of Code also has teacher resources with teacher guides and activities already created.  Since I have to find free resources for this class to use for teaching this is a great start for myself and my students. It is important to share that the lack of resources available even on youtube for teachers for Hour of Code are phenomenal. 


### Hardware Specifications


Students have:
HP Chromebook 
Chrome OS 64
Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 600
4 GB memory; 32 GB eMMC 
4 GB LPDDr4-3733 MHz RAM


Teachers have:
Lenovo Thinkpad 
Windows 10
Intel Core i7 6600U (4MB Cache, Up to 3.4 GHz)
12 GB Memory; SSD	256GB



### Application
Day to Day:
Because my students do not all have access to reliable internet at home they will have their day to day reflect no homework assigned. 

Problets- First students will be assigned groups of four students they can ask for guidance on their problets in the beginning of class. This is a daily activity we will have to sharpen on the arithmetic skills and basic coding. Students will get immediate feedback if they get a small coding problem. This will take minutes and will be our opening activity just like a warmup.

Labs- Will presented once a week and will be worked on during the remainder of the week. Students have 5 days to complete their labs and keep a Computer Scientists reflection journal to document their struggles or success. Also, students will document their learning and what they hope to learn in the future from their struggles. Labs will be done weekly. Students will use their four team members to get their guidance. Because of the situation I have in my classroom students need to utilize every second of class to finish work instead of doing this a home.  Labs will be turned in by submitting screenshots of their code on Schoology, which is what my district uses to input grades and classwork for students. 

Projects will be only assigned two weeks prior to the final of each semester. 



### Impacts


This impact section will address topics in Computer Science Education that are currently affecting students of different backgrounds and have contributed to the lack of representation in the field of their Computer Science. The first group of students who have been misrepresented in the STEM fields which are students who do not have internet access at home or even access to basic internet. The second group of students who have been affected are women. Lastly students of color have also been almost nonexistent in this field.

It is crucial to address the focus of this course to understand how it will help minority, students of lower communities, and women join the field. This course is designed to expose all students to the world of coding and its possibility of creating their creative solutions to the problems of today and even the future. Although students will not be creating code in  C++, C, Python, or Java they will have an introduction to a course before they have decided that they enjoy coding. It is an important course that will either make students love coding or just decide it is not for them. Students of this district who are majority minorities will be exposed to basic coding software that is available online with block coding where commands are easier to understand for those who are just becoming familiar with coding.  With this exposure I hope that students will pursue to learn more about non-block coding programs and one day help others who might not know of the existence of coding. This class will help my students understand about some of the history of Computer Science and how representation in STEM fields lack people like them and this could be a reason why there are some solutions unsolved we need them in the field. The technology used in this class will be Scratch which is a great platform to promote creativity and get students to see this coding as  a game and hopefully will lure in students who have not been represented in the field.

Representation in Computer Science matters. In Computer Science it is important to understand that historically those who had money would be able to access computers and the internet while those who did not were left behind. Early marketing aimed to sell computers to affluent, white boys. This leaves students of colors and women out of the fields of computer science for many years. Because of this it is important that our students are able access computer science classes make up for all the years they were left out of the narrative. According to an article on PBS, African American and Hispanics made less than 10% of the Computer Science workforce. My district has predominately students of color who can no longer be ignored or set aside from these fields because we need their own creativity to solve the next set of problems of the 21st century. In my school district my students deserve the right to be able to choose to go into this field regardless of their gender and their skin color or gender. Coding no longer is a manâ€™s world as you can see sites like SheCodes aim to promote more women to become Computer Scientists. According to SheCodes 25% of women are in the field of Computer Science and make 30%. Thankfully this course will allow students to be exposed to creatively making their assignments and hopefully my students will grow to enjoy coding by using Hour of Code or Scratch. Aside from Hour of Code and Scratch having various projects in the class having problets in class that are group based are crucial to make everyone feel welcome in this class regardless of gender of color. The environment should be welcoming to all and this is my way to make this happen.

The digital divide that exists during this time is an important reason why this course should be taught in any school district. Every child should have the opportunity to know the basics of computers but also learn that computers are not just for browsing the web but can help resolve problems or can be used to showcase their creativity. Since not everyone has access to a computer it is important that by allowing students to join this course they are able to close the gap between those who have grown with computers at home and feel very comfortable with their usage and have an advantage between those who have not. Sparking interest in students of all economic status is important. To help students I will have no homework and the entire class will be classwork based to allow all students to reach success.

Approaches for this class based on my situation and the history of Computer Science include having assignments be completed in class to avoid anyone not doing their work at home due to internet connection but most importantly to allow students to ask for guidance. The last thing that I want from my students is for them to be discouraged because the course has a lot of gaps for them, or they are not getting help at home. Finding someone who can work with block coding or even coding is hard enough so this is the support that will be in place in the classroom. The Problets are a way to engage the class as a whole and create good conversations within class time. Again all of this will be done to create an environment where students can ask questions and they can be included in the learning. Using this, I hope will get all students to feel like they are  future Computer Scientists.
