# Ms. Barboza's Educational Technology Plan


## Context

### Course

>Introduction Computer Science course for Middle Schoolers

### Situation
Assets at my school that will help are the large computer classes provided for me to teach in. Students will have no problem accesing the web when working on the programs.
A constraint that we have at our campus is that students are taking a computer class for the very first time and there is no resources for teachers like textbooks for this course. Since the computer lab is big the computer class will be a huge class. Not all students will get that 1-1 attention they need. Not all students have internet access at home to complete their homework.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

Online software used in the classroom will be Scratch as well as Hour of Code. Teachers and students will use both. Students will use Schoology to submit reflection pieces during the classroom.

### Hardware Specifications

Teacher computer will be a LENOVO THINKPAD as personal devices but will use a 
In the computer classroom students use MAC's. Network is wireless.
All computers on campus are limited to websites due to school district firewall but this can change for my students if I message my technology department in the School District.
The Lenovo Thinkpad can hook up to my projector and can be displayed wirelessly for our classroom lessons.
Students can attend office hours via google meet and if we are back online they will meet on google meet.
### Application
Scratch will help students go through challenges through out the classroom. 
Students will always get the answers in class by giving them small "hacks" that will guide them to start on their Scratch code. First students will come to class and
get a paper that has some short cuts to create the program we need. Students will start with Scratch starter projects to help them learn new concepts in coding.
Outside of my classroom students will be given starter codes and reflection pieces. Homework will be given in class and worked on in class during the week to help students have a guide as they are doing their work. Assessments will be on basic coding language of Scratch. Students will be asked to complete basic codes in Scratch as part of quiz grades and more complicated codes will be required for tests.Homework has to be done in class in order to provide all students with a computer that can support the software and has fast internet. Addiitonally students need to demonstrate their knowledge of basic commands on scratch and should be given an opportunity to show their knowledge. 

### Impacts


How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or 
evolving course contexts.
